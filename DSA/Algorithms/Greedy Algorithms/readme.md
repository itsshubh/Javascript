A greedy algorithm 
- It is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. 
- It builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit

Limitations
Sometimes greedy algorithms fail to find the globally optimal solution because they do not consider all the data. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices it has made so far, but it is not aware of future choices it could make or it could had made.
