## Quick Sort

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

- Always pick first element as pivot.
- Always pick last element as pivot.
- Pick a random element as pivot.
- Pick median as pivot.

The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

### Partition Algorithm
The logic is, we start from the leftmost element and keep track of index of smaller (or equal to) elements as i. While traversing, if we find a smaller element, we swap current element with arr[i]. Otherwise we ignore current element.


### Quicksort Complexity

__Time Complexities__

__Worst Case Complexity [Big-O]: O(n2)__
It occurs when the pivot element picked is either the greatest or the smallest element.
This condition leads to the case in which the pivot element lies in an extreme end of the sorted array. One sub-array is always empty and another sub-array contains n - 1 elements. Thus, quicksort is called only on this sub-array.
However, the quick sort algorithm has better performance for scattered pivots.

__Best Case Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n*log n)__
It occurs when the pivot element is always the middle element or near to the middle element.

__Average Case Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n*log n)__
It occurs when the above conditions do not occur.

__Space Complexity__

__The space complexity for quicksort is O(log n).__


### Quicksort Applications

Quicksort is implemented when
- the programming language is good for recursion
- time complexity matters
- space complexity matters


### Notes


- Although the worst case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2) which is more than many other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort, QuickSort is faster in practice, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world data. QuickSort can be implemented in different ways by changing the choice of pivot, so that the worst case rarely occurs for a given type of data. However, merge sort is generally considered better when data is huge and stored in external storage.

- Why Quick Sort is preferred over MergeSort for sorting Arrays:-    
Quick Sort in its general form is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesn’t require any extra storage) whereas merge sort requires O(N) extra storage, N denoting the array size which may be quite expensive. Allocating and de-allocating the extra space used for merge sort increases the running time of the algorithm. Comparing average complexity we find that both type of sorts have O(NlogN) average complexity but the constants differ. For arrays, merge sort loses due to the use of extra O(N) storage space.

- Quick Sort is also a cache friendly sorting algorithm as it has good locality of reference when used for arrays.

- Why MergeSort is preferred over QuickSort for Linked Lists?  
In case of linked lists the case is different mainly due to difference in memory allocation of arrays and linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked list nodes may not be adjacent in memory. Unlike array, in linked list, we can insert items in the middle in O
(1) extra space and O(1) time. Therefore merge operation of merge sort can be implemented without extra space for linked lists.

In arrays, we can do random access as elements are continuous in memory. Let us say we have an integer (4-byte) array A and let the address of A[0] be x then to access A[i], we can directly access the memory at (x + i*4). Unlike arrays, we can not do random access in linked list. Quick Sort requires a lot of this kind of access. In linked list to access i’th index, we have to travel each and every node from the head to i’th node as we don’t have continuous block of memory. Therefore, the overhead increases for quick sort. Merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random access is low.
