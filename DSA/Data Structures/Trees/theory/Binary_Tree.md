## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children.

__Types of Binary Tree__

__1. Full Binary Tree__[Full Binary Tree](./Full_Binary_Tree.md)
A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

__2. Perfect Binary Tree__[Perfect Binary Tree](./Perfect_Binary_Tree.md)
A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

__3. Complete Binary Tree__[Complete Binary Tree](./Complete_Binary_Tree.md)
A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences

- Every level must be completely filled
- All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
- The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.

__4. Degenerate or Pathological Tree__
A degenerate or pathological tree is the tree having a single child either left or right.

__5. Skewed Binary Tree__
A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes. Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree.

__6. Balanced Binary Tree__[Balanced Binary Tree](./Balanced_Binary_Tree.md)
It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.


__Binary Tree Applications__
- For easy and quick access to data
- In router algorithms
- To implement heap data structure
- Syntax tree
