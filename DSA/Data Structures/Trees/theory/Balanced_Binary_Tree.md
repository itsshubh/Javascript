## Balanced Binary Tree

A balanced binary tree, also referred to as a height-balanced binary tree, is defined as a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than 1.

Following are the conditions for a height-balanced binary tree:
1. Difference between the left and the right subtree for any node is not more than one
2. The left subtree is balanced
3. The right subtree is balanced
