## Full Binary Tree

A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
It is also known as a proper binary tree.

__Full Binary Tree Theorems__
    Let, i = the number of internal nodes
        n = be the total number of nodes
        l = number of leaves
        λ = number of levels
        
- The number of leaves is i + 1.
- The total number of nodes is 2i + 1.
- The number of internal nodes is (n – 1) / 2.
- The number of leaves is (n + 1) / 2.
- The total number of nodes is 2l – 1.
- The number of internal nodes is l – 1.
- The number of leaves is at most 2λ - 1.
