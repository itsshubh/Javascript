### Trees

A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.


## Why Trees?
1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer:

### File system

        /    <-- root
      /      \
    ...       home
          /          \
      ugrad        course
        /       /      |     \
      ...      cs101  cs112  cs113  

2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays). 
3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists). 
4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers. 

__Main applications of trees include:__
- Manipulate hierarchical data.
- Manipulate sorted lists of data.
- Form of a multi-stage decision-making.
- Binary Search Trees(BSTs) are used to quickly check whether an element is present in a set or not.
- Heap is a kind of tree that is used for heap sort.
- A modified version of a tree called Tries is used in modern routers to store routing information.
- Most popular databases use B-Trees and T-Trees, which are variants of the tree structure we learned above to store their data.
- Compilers use a syntax tree to validate the syntax of every program you write.

## Tree Terminologies
__Node__
- A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
- The last nodes of each path are called __leaf nodes or external nodes__ that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.
- The node having at least a child node is called an __internal node__.

__Edge__
It is the link between any two nodes.

__Root__
It is the topmost node of a tree.

__Height of a Node__
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).

__Depth of a Node__
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

__Height of a Tree__
The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.

__Degree of a Node__
The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.

__Forest__
- A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.
- You can create a forest by cutting the root of a tree.


## Types of Tree
1. Binary Tree  [Binary Tree](./theory/Binary_Tree.md)
2. Binary Search Tree [Binary Search Tree](./theory/Binary_Search_Tree.md)
3. AVL Tree [AVL Tree](./theory/AVL_Tree.md)
4. B-Tree [B-Tree](./theory/B_Tree.md)

## Tree Traversal [Tree Traversal](./theory/Tree_Traversal.md)
In order to perform any operation on a tree, you need to reach to the specific node. The tree traversal algorithm helps in visiting a required node in the tree.
